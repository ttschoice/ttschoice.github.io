We’ve created this page as a living resource to supplement our research paper on TTS voice evaluation, published at the ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI) 2020.

Listening to long-form content is increasingly common, and the voice reading that content plays a significant role in shaping the user experience. In our work, we developed a method for evaluating the quality of voices for listening to long-form content. The analysis presented in the paper reports on a large-scale evaluation of 21 voices (18 TTS, 3 human). Below, you’ll find examples of those voice clips and additional information beyond what appeared in the paper. We may also expand our original analysis by including additional voices in the future, and will welcome community contributions using our method to evaluate voices as well.


## Listen to the TTS voices
In our research study, participants listened to one of 21 voices reading an article [Reduce Your Stress in Two Minutes a Day](https://getpocket.com/explore/item/reduce-your-stress-in-two-minutes-a-day).

Here are 10-second clips of each of those voices reading a portion of the article:


## Technical features
What&mdash;more "objectively"&mdash;may have contributed to the observed differences in listeners’ preferences? While our focus is primarily on informing end users of TTS voices rather than speech synthesis engineers, we present this information as another feature that may help select synthesized voices, particularly for voices where the model details are known, but no listening test has been conducted.

One important word of caution: our TTS recordings were generated through end-user APIs and, without direct contact with the developers, it is difficult to identify the synthesis models or technical features of the voices with absolute certainty. Please note that (except where indicated), the synthesis approach listed is based on the best guess of experts in the speech synthesis field.
